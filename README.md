<b>The first pastel icon pack designed for macOS</b>
<br>
<br>
In NeoPastel, you will find +140 matching icons designed primarily for macOS. Mixing Neumorphism and Pastel, this icon pack was created in the goal to bring my own touch to macOS. Quick reminder that this icon pack is available for free. You can get it down below for your devices in the downloads section.
