# NeoPastel

<b>The first pastel icon pack designed for macOS</b>
<br>
<br>
In NeoPastel, you will find +170 matching icons designed primarily for macOS. Mixing Neumorphism and Pastel, this icon pack was created in the goal to bring my own touch to macOS. You can become a beta tester at https://neopastel.netlify.app .

If you want a pack similar to this one on iOS, you can check MaisyLeigh's website.
